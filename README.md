# stacktogif
This is a simple Spring powered app that works with 2 json files — one from Open Exchange Rates and another from Giphy. 
It compares rates of RUB to selected currency (USD by default) today vs selected date (yesterday by default). 
In response this webapp will show you a gif — if rate got worse random gif with "broke" tag and if rate got better — "rich".

# how to run
Open in IDE and run DemoApplicaion. Then go in your browser to localhost:8080 and you are ready to work with the app!
